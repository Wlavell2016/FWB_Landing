                <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                <p>At the Ontario Native Women’s Association, there is a provincial program called “Circles of Care”. The Circles of Care Program is funded by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services through the Walking Together: Ontario’s Long-Term Strategy
                    to End Violence Against Indigenous Women and its Family Wellbeing Program. The program is designed to meet the unique needs of Indigenous women and their children who are involved with both the child welfare system and violence against
                    women sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program supports Indigenous women in a culturally rooted, holistic way, so that women are better able to navigate through the complex systems encountered when experiencing violence and involvement in child welfare matters. The program model supports
                    individuals who arrive at the door “in crisis” by first stabilizing their current situation, and then building the support systems that are needed to move and stay away from crisis situations".
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6  photo2">
                <p>
                    The Circles of Care Program focus on Indigenous women and their children who are involved in the child welfare system. This program also supports families who are experiencing or who have experienced violence in their lives. The program is designed to
                    support families in crisis and empower women to examine their current situation and create safe and supportive means of living for themselves and their families.

                        <li>
                            Numerous discussions with provincial and national groups.

                        The Circles of Care Program is designed to meet the unique needs of Indigenous women who are involved with both the child welfare system and violence against women sector.</p>
                        The programme will utilize a comprehensive approach to addressing and eradicating violence against Indigenous women and their children, while enhancing supports across service areas in order to strengthen Indigenous women’s roles as leaders and caregivers in their families and communities.

                    <li>
                        Advocates are needed. Women feel stronger when they have someone to help them sort through the requirements of the systems, to go to interviews and meetings with agency representatives and other service providers, and to help make sure services are working
                        for Indigenous women.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is key to develop services collaboratively, to integrate new advocacy initiatives with existing programs and to share information, training, and resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More Indigenous healing centres and community programs are needed to provide culturally restorative, holistic services for women and their families, to strengthen them and support their well-being.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A stronger focus on prevention and follow-up is needed, including support to women who are in crisis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Education and awareness is important for Indigenous women.

The aim of the program is to create safe spaces that are individualized to meet the Indigenous woman’s unique needs and preferences, to provide the space for her to speak her truths, access supports and tools to enhance her wellbeing, leadership, and health, without disruption.

                                Inform and educate women as they navigate the complexities of the VAW or CAS systems, so that women access services they need and learn to navigate these services for themselves
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Educate and coach the women to articulate their own concerns, needs, and goals effectively, to plan ways to move forward in their lives, and to advocate for themselves and their families
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provide a circle of care that responds to the cultural, mental, physical, emotional and spiritual needs of the woman through close collaboration with Indigenous and non-Indigenous services in the community
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Safe spaces are diversely expressed and accessed at each Program site, for example: walking on nature trails, ceremony, sharing circles, culturally designed physical space and one–on-one conversations in a quiet, comfortable place. The aim of the program is to create safe spaces that are individualized to meet the Indigenous woman’s unique needs and preferences, to provide the space for her to speak her truths, access supports and tools to enhance her wellbeing, leadership, and health, without disruption.
