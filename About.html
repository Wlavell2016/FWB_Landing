                            <h1>VISION:</h1> At ONWA we will support women to take up their leadership roles in the family and in the community. ONWA will support women’s leadership. To do that we have to ensure that our voices are heard. And we have to start by listening to
                            each other first.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    To reclaim our voices we must have knowledge.  Much of the knowledge we need to be strong leaders is rooted in the cultural teachings.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To hear our own voices we must silence our pain and trauma and find a place for it in our lives that does not hurt us.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Our self-esteem needs to be reclaimed.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            So when we speak we will have a grounded, balanced, strong, kind voice. To achieve our leadership roles we have to break the cycle of abuse that is part of our families and communities.
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-4   p-3">
                            <p>
                                To do that we will, through all of our actions and words, not carry forward the abuse. We will speak the truth because we will know what the truth is. We will be forgiving and move forward after our truth has been shared.  We will not use the colonization
                                behaviours we have learned to hurt others. We will believe in our truth and respect it. We will expect board members and our Executive Director to reflect this vision of behaviour.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When they do not behave in this way we will gently ask them to realign their behaviour. We will be focused in our work and not exhaust the staff or board. We recognize that any issue we chose to work on, with focused resolve, will support women to move
                                forward in all issues, because all issues are interconnected. In being leaders in our families our focus must be on the children:
                            </p>

                                    We take up our role for the children and address the child welfare system. We will build a child welfare system that is transformed and recognizes that the shattered, hurt parent needs love, care and attention, just as her children do. We will create
                                    new ways of healing families that are based on the cultural teachings. We help each woman change her life for the better.

                                    We will trust in ourselves and in each other that we can realize this vision. We will love and care for each other.

                        To do that we will, through all of our actions and words, not carry forward the abuse. We will speak the truth because we will know what the truth is. We will be forgiving and move forward after our truth has been shared.  We will not use the colonization
                        behaviours we have learned to hurt others. We will believe in our truth and respect it. We will expect board members and our Executive Director to reflect this vision of behaviour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When they do not behave in this way we will gently ask them to realign their behaviour. We will be focused in our work and not exhaust the staff or board. We recognize that any issue we chose to work on, with focused resolve, will support women to move
                        forward in all issues, because all issues are interconnected. In being leaders in our families our focus must be on the children:
